# Coding-Quiz
## Challenge 4


## Desciption 
It took me a while to figure out the best approach to this project, I actually ended up having to start over on this because my first approach was no   workingat all. I'm glad I started over though because I am happy with the end result. And learned a lot along the way. I met most of the requirements fo  this excepthaving the highscores display on the actual highscore page. The data is kept locally as the application tab in chrome devtools shows, I jus   couldn't get thatinformation to show up on the actual Highscore page unfortunately. However I still am very pleased with how this turned out, both visuall    (especiallyvisually, how about those button animations, if you fail the test, at least you can just hover over the buttons for pure satisfaction instead.  but was alsopleased with the functionality of the quiz too. As a graphic designer I want everything I code to look as good as it can with the knowledge o    coding Ipossess, and as this site could still definitely use some design improvements, I like how I made a coding quiz have a little personality to it There is alsosome cool "mouse" css styling done as well. I added a text selection css rule for those who like to highlight when they read to add a nic  subtle surprise tothe site and I have the cursor switch to a "pointer" when hovering over any button. The functionality of the code quiz I think works wel   too! You can readmore about that in the "usage" section of the README.

## Installation

## Usage
 
The functionality and usage of the code quiz is pretty easy to use, but just to be on the safe side. The welcome page has a "view high scores" button which when clicked will take the user to a second welcome screen that was made specifically to show the highscores from people who have taken the test. If the user clicks the "Start quiz" button that will start a quiz with a series of very nerdy questions, good-luck. The play again button can be used to start the quiz too but is intended to use at the end of the quiz after you submit your score. If a user wants to try the test again for a better score, that would be how you get back to the start of the quiz. Once the quiz is started a timer will start counting down from 100 and each question answered incorrectly will subtract 5 seconds off the clock. During the time taking the quiz, you will be shown whether or not you got the previous question correct or incorrect, but if you lose track, don't worry. At the end of the quiz you will be shown how many questions you got right. Once you enter your initials and hit submit, you will be brought back to the welcome page. During your time taking the quiz, if you answer incorrectly, a prompt will also pop up altering the user. There is one other alert prompt on the "Initial here" input, just letting the user know if they hit submit but kept that blank, they have to enter something in the field. If a user runs out of time, they will alter that time and take it to the end of the page to submit a score and try again, any unanswered questions will be considered wrong.
